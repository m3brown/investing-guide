## What are the things I can invest in?

This differs for everyone, there’s no single right answer. There are general guidelines (see the [Three Fund Portfolio](#the-three-fund-portfolio) later in this doc) that the investment community rallies around… but even then, there’s wiggle room for individual risk tolerance.

This list focuses on investments you can buy from your desk. It does not include active (physical and time) investments like flipping or renting houses.

### Mutual Funds
- Actively or passively managed, active will have higher fees.
- There are LOTS of fund options. The most common fund portfolio focus options
    - Domestic Stock
        - Total domestic market
        - Large/Medium/Small Cap
        - Value, Growth ([read more on Value and Growth](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/mutual-funds/2-schools-growth-vs-value))
        - Sector/Industry (Technology, Real Estate/REIT, Energy, etc.)
    - International Stock
        - Total international market
        - Emerging Markets
    - Bonds
        - Domestic Bonds
        - International Bonds
    - Target Date Funds
        - These funds manage a ratio of Domestic, International, and Bonds that varies as time goes on (i.e. more bonds as you get older to reduce risk).
        - E.g. 2055 Target Date Fund would be ideal for someone that wants to retire in 2055.`

### Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
These are pretty much the same as mutual funds above. The most notable differences:
You can buy and sell exact dollar amounts of Mutual Funds (i.e. $200 exactly). ETFs have a market rate (e.g. $150) so you can’t buy exactly $200. But you could buy $150 or $300.
[ETFs often have fewer taxable events](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/tax-efficiency-etf-vs-mutual-fund/L1sYF0Ec3), which results in less capital gains to report each year in taxes. This makes ETFs slightly more preferred than Mutual Funds. But the difference is fairly small.

### Individual stocks and crypto
See “resist the urge to outsmart the market” later in this doc

### Individual bonds
- Municipal bonds
- Treasury bonds

### Become an accredited investor
To purchase certain investments, you must be an [accredited investor](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-an-accredited-investor).
- Unregulated investments (higher risk)
- Only for high earners
- Examples:
    - Private equity/real estate
    - Hedge funds
    - Venture capital
