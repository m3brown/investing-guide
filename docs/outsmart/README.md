## Resist the urge to outsmart the market

### Stock market historical growth

S&P 500 historical growth:
- The average annualized return since its inception in 1928 through Dec. 31, 2023, is **9.90%**.
- The average annualized return since adopting 500 stocks into the index in 1957 through Dec. 31, 2023, is **10.26%**.

When investing long term (e.g. 30+ years), simply mirroring the stock market as a whole:
- will result in a comfortable retirement
- may result in significant wealth

In other words, you don't need to "get lucky" or "discover the next Apple/Google/etc." to have a comfortable retirement. It should be sufficient to just invest in the market as a whole.

A quick example:

```
Invest $25,000 annually for 30 years
- assuming average S&P return of 9%
- assuming inflation of 3%

Total contributions: $750,000
Total portfolio: $2.25 million (in today's dollars)
  - which would support a $90k/year withdrawal (in today's dollars)
```

### “Invest early” over “timing the market”

{% hint 'quote' %}
Time in market over timing the market
{% endhint %}

It’s tempting to save money for when the market is “down”, but it’s actually really difficult to predict when exactly the market is at the bottom.

A large portion of market growth is in a small number of days in the year. In other words, there are a couple big spikes each year. You might miss those if you’re holding money waiting for the right time.

### “Diversified funds” over “individual stocks”

It’s natural to dream about “making it big” with a stock that has massive growth, like the early investors in Apple and Microsoft.

- Buying an index fund is a bet that the market as a whole will continue to grow like it has over the last 100 years.

- Buying an individual company’s stock is a bet that it will grow faster than the market average.

It’s possible that “being the market” is sufficient for a happy and fruitful retirement, without the need to “beat the market”.

### The Three Fund Portfolio

There are many index funds out there, so “use index funds” is overly simplistic. It really can be overwhelming to browse all the fund options.

A popular approach is to focus investment money on just 3 funds:

- US total market (or S&P 500) index fund - this is the primary allocation
- International index fund - America doesn’t always grow faster than the rest of the world
- Bond index fund - these are a low-risk safety net for bad years

> This all-indexed portfolio contains over 15,000 worldwide securities, in just three easily-managed funds, that has outperformed the vast majority of both professional and amateur investors.

What ratio of your money you put into each depends on your age.

**Fun Fact: most brokerages have “Target Date Funds” that are Three Fund Portfolios where they manage the ratios for you over the years.**

For example, here’s the mapping for Vanguard’s Target Date Index Funds:

| Age | % US | % Non-US | % Bonds |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
|20 | 54% | 36% | 10% |
|25| 54%| 36%| 10% |
|30|54%|36%|10%|
|35|54%|36%|10%|
|40|54%|36%|10%|
|45|50%|33%|17%|
|50|46%|30%|24%|
|55|41%|27%|32%|
|60|36%|24%|40%|
|65|30%|20%|50%|
|70|21%|14%|65%|
|75+|18%|12%|70%|
