# What accounts should I have?

## Use a free online brokerage for after-tax investing

- I recommend one of: Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab
  - The brokerage should offer financial advisory services for an extra fee, but not REQUIRE those services/fees.
    - Ensure the advisors are a [fiduciary](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/fiduciary)
    - [Broker is not your buddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQuR3oljviw) (Youtube)
- To simplify (consolidate) your portfolio, you can transfer in tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, HSA, etc.) that you may already have open with other vendors.

## Use a High Yield Savings Account (HYSA) for cash reserves

- Interest rates below inflation are effectively “losing money”
- A 4% account (e.g. Capital One) earns 400x more interest than a .01% account (e.g. Chase)
- Pairing Checking and savings accounts with one company may enable instant transfers. Keep most of the money in the high-interest savings bucket until you need it.

## Tax advantaged accounts

Tax advantaged accounts are important to understand because

- Reduction in taxes allows for money to grow much faster over time
- The amount you can put in each year is limited, forcing you to contribute consistently over a long period of time

My general recommendation is `put as much money as you can into tax-advantaged accounts`. The types of accounts available varies from person to person, depending on income level and what your employer offers.

| Account Type    | Tax-Free money in | Tax-Free earnings while invested | Tax-Free when taking money out | Early withdrawals permitted[^1] |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| HSA             | ✔                 | ✔                                | ✔[^2]                          |                                 |
| 401k            | ✔                 | ✔                                |                                |                                 |
| Roth 401k       |                   |                                  | ✔                              | ✔                               |
| Traditional IRA | ✔[^3]             | ✔                                |                                | ✔                               |
| Roth IRA        |                   | ✔                                | ✔                              | ✔                               |
| 529 (college)   |                   | [^4]                             | ✔[^2]                          | ✔                               |

  [^1] Withdrawals before retirement are tax free for principle (not earnings) and/or for eligible life events  
  [^2] HSA and 529 withdrawals are only tax free for applicable expenses (health, education)  
  [^3] Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductable for people earning under 87k in 2024 (or 147k filing jointly)  
  [^4] 529 are subject to federal tax, but [many states offer a STATE tax deduction](https://smartasset.com/taxes/529-plan-tax-deductions-for-every-state)

## Maximizing your tax-advantaged contributions each year

Consider "maxing out" all the tax-advantage accounts available to you.

For high earners, the maximum tax benefit can be achieved by… (2024 limits provided)

- $23,000 (per person) to 401k or Roth 401k
- $7,000 (per person) to Roth IRA (via [Backdoor Roth](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/how-to-set-up-backdoor-ira) for people making over $146k)
- Set up two 529 accounts per child (one for each parent)
- Contribute 4k to each account. For 3 kids this is 4k\*2\*3 = $24,000
- If in a high deductible health-care plan, contribute $8,300 (per family) to the plan’s HSA
