# When Can I Retire?

The 4% is a common (and simple) strategy for identifying when you can safely retire and live off your savings.

To summarize it simply:

- The market grows on average about 4% each year after inflation
- Therefore, if you spend only 4% each year, you can live off of the gains without spending any of your principle

In reality, there’s a lot more to this than the above. I suggest reading [Schwab: Beyond the 4% Rule: How Much Can You Spend in Retirement?](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/beyond-4-rule-how-much-can-you-spend-retirement) to understand the bigger picture. Nevertheless, the 4% rule gives you a rough target to strive for.

## 4% Rule Example

Suppose I can pay all my bills and enjoy life with $50,000 in today’s dollars.

```
50,000 / .04 = 1.25 million
```

Therefore, you could consider retiring when you have $1.25 million in your investment portfolio.

{% hint 'warning' %}
Please consult with a financial advisor before making a determination, though. The 4% rule doesn’t sufficiently account for things like taxes, social security, health insurance, etc.
